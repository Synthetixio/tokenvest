# Tokenvest

**Note:** The front-end now relies on Multicall3. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_MULTICALL_ADDRESS` accordingly.

## Overview

This is a smart contract and dApp that manages token grants with vesting schedules.

Each grant is represented as an NFT. It has the following properties:

- `tokenAddress` - The address of the tokens being provided by the grant.
- `startTimestamp` - The timestamp (in seconds) when the grant begins to vest.
- `cliffTimestamp` - The timestamp (in seconds) before which no tokens can be redeemed.
- `vestInterval` - The duration (in seconds) for each additional amount to vest.
- `vestAmount` - The amount of tokens that will vest each interval.
- `totalAmount` - The total amount of tokens that will vest for this grant.
- `amountRedeemed` - The amount of tokens already redeemed under this grant.
- `cancelled` - Whether this grant was cancelled by the contract, this is the only mutable property.

The contract owner is able to manage grants using the `mint()`, `cancelGrant()`, and `replaceGrant()` functions. The owner can also withdraw tokens using the `withdraw()` function. The dApp assumes this will be a multisig wallet on Gnosis Safe. Ownership can be transferred using the `nominateOwner()` and `acceptOwnership()` functions.

Holders of the NFT are able to redeem available tokens using the `redeem()`, `redeemMultiple()`, `redeemAll()`, or `redeemWithTransfer()` methods.

## Development Environment

- Run `npx hardhat node`
- In a separate tab, `npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/local-deploy.js`
- Then start the front end, `cd frontend && npm run dev` (ensure to `npm i` here as well). Owner is HH wallet 0, grantee is HH wallet 1.

## Technical Specification

This an ERC-721 contract that implements the enumerable extension. Each NFT corresponds to a grant and allows the grantee to redeem ERC-20 tokens from the contract according to a specified vesting scheduling.

### Owner

- The contract has a single owner, initialized in the constructor.
- Ownership can be transferred by nominating a new owner using the `nominateOwner()` function. The nominated owner can then claim ownership by calling `acceptOwnership()`. Only the current owner should be able to nominate a new owner. Only the nominated owner (`nominatedOwner`) should be able to accept ownership.
- The owner is expected to supply tokens being granted with this contract (`tokenAddress`) to the contract using `supply()`, though anyone could transfer any tokens to this contract.
- The owner, and only the owner, should be able to withdraw all of any token from the contract using the `withdraw()` method.
- The owner, and only the owner, can issue a new grant using the `mint()` function, specifying the grantee's address and all of the properties in the `Grant` struct. `tokenCounter` increments such that each grant always has a unique ID.
- The owner, and only the owner, can replace a grant based on it's token ID. This should mint a replacement grant with new attributes to the previous grantee.
- The owner, and only the owner, should be able to cancel a grant with the `cancelGrant()` function. No one, including the grantee assigned to that grant, should be able to redeem tokens based on a grant that has been cancelled.

### Grantee

- The grantee (and only the grantee) should be able to redeem tokens from the contract according to the vesting schedule associated with the NFTs they hold.
  - Starting at the `startTimestamp`, each `vestInterval` should vest `vestAmount` of tokens.
  - No tokens should vest prior to the `cliffTimestamp`, but this should not be taken into account when calculating the amount vested after the cliff has passed. For example, given a `vestAmount` of 100, a `vestInterval` of 3 months, and a `cliffTimestamp` of +6 months, 0 tokens should be vested at +5 months, 200 tokens should be vested at +6 months, and 300 tokens should be vested at +9 months.
  - Under no circumstances should a grant provide access to more than the `totalAmount` of tokens.
  - Users are able to redeem the amount of vested tokens minus the amount of tokens they've already redeemed.
- The grantee (and only the grantee) should be able to redeem tokens (as specified above) and also transfer any amount of any ERC-20 token to this contract in a single transaction using the `redeemWithTransfer()` function.
- The grantee should be able to transfer that grant to another address using the standard functions in the ERC-721 specification.
